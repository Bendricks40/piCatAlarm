Created as the ultimate cat deterrent for incredibly rude felines who jump on top of counter tops when their owners are gone! This script looks for motion on the Raspberry pi using a basic PIR sensor, and when detected, starts video recording and then plays an obnoxious yelling of "get off the counter!". Note that having a separate video folder in your project directory is needed.
